You have spent your entire life on the outskirts of society, hunted by the law because of the unfortunate circumstances of your birth.",
  Entertainer:
    "Freakshow: Your sorcerous origin has left you with a prominent supernatural mark or deformity that is difficult to hide. Unable to find employment due to your appearance, you joined a traveling carnival, where your disfigurement was shown to shocked and disgusted spectators. You made a decent amount of coin with the carnival, but always resented the dehumanizing work.",
  Folk_Hero:
    "Protector: When your small village was threatened by a much larger foe, your sorcerous blood revealed itself. It may have revealed itself because of the stress, a near-fatal wound, or you could have knowingly kept it hidden this whole time. Regardless of its nature, you fought off the threat by yourself and became celebrated as a hero because of it.",
  Guild_Artisan:
    "Purchased Power: You weren't born with your sorcerous ability, you bought it. You were a wealthy merchant with an interest in purchasing magical artifacts. Either intentionally or unintentionally, you purchased a magical relic that was salvaged from a dungeon that granted you magical ability when you came in contact with it. Perhaps the artifact belonged to a being of immense power, or simply needed to come in contact with your bloodline to be activated. You keep the object securely in your possession, and make sure not to lose it.",
  Hermit:
    "Enlightened: Your magical ability manifested itself after meditation and long isolation. You entered seclusion or joined a monastery to gain a greater understanding of your inner self. After a long period of self-contemplation, you discovered the spark of magic that burned within your soul, and learned how to control it.",
  Noble:
    "Blue Blood: A sorcerous bloodline is quite a valuable thing to marry into for those without magical ability; it is not unheard of for wealthy families to try and marry into sorcerous bloodlines to strengthen the family name and produce powerful offspring. You are the result of such a marriage, and are the youngest in a family of mage-aristocrats.",
  Outlander:
    "Feral Child: You were born under a bad omen, such as an eclipse, the death of a king, or on a Friday the 13th. Your superstitious parents abandoned you in the wilderness when you were an infant to escape misfortune, and left you to succumb to the elements. You survived, however; you were found by a wild animal who could sense the magic within you and sought to protect you as their own. You grew up knowing only your basic instincts, until you were found by a hunter.",
  Sage: "School For Gifted Youngsters: When your sorcerous powers revealed themselves to you when you were a child, you were sent to a school for the magically-inclined. While there, you learned to control your magical powers under the instruction of more senior sorcerers.",
  Sailor:
    "Monsoon-Born: You were born during a freak occurrence of weather, such as a flood, lightning storm, or tsunami. This caused you to have a natural affinity for the water, a talent that manifested as a skill for sailing and swimming. You were a member of a ship's crew, and aided them with your power to control wind and weather.",
  Soldier:
    "Super Soldier: Officers and generals are always looking for ways to use magic to make their armies the strongest in the land. The army you served in was subjected to a dangerous alchemical substance with the hopes of turning them into powerful warriors. Many of your comrades died or were disfigured as a result of the side-effects, but you were lucky enough to survive and be given magical talents as a result.",
  Urchin:
    "Familicide: Magical talent is difficult to control when you are young, especially if you live in a stressful or abusive environment. Your sorcerous powers manifested explosively when you were a child, which resulted in the death of your parents or caretakers. With no one left to look after you, you were reduced to living on the streets, using your wits and magical ability to survive.",

    "The Chained God: Long ago, your church declared a crusade against an otherworldly foe that terrorized the land. An army of crusaders left the Material Plane and marched into another plane of existence, hoping to purge all that threatened the safety of the world. The crusaders captured a powerful heretic god, and imprisoned it inside a holy site. With time, the church learned how to siphon the deity's power, and taught their priests to use its magic. You are one of such Ur-Warlocks. Although you are confident in your ability to control your Pact Magic, many fear the Bound Beast will not remain shackled forever.",
  Charlatan:
    "Debtor: You gambled away every coin you had at the betting table, and saw your life go up in flames. Your friends and family all deserted you, fed up with your irresponsibility and your pleas for more money. Homeless, with no one to turn to for help, you eagerly accepted help from a strange individual offering to set you up with a new life, far away from this ruined one. While you have escaped financial ruin, your otherworldly debts are now a much, much bigger problem.",

    "Hell Hound On My Trail: As an aspiring young Bard, you had aspirations of becoming a world-famous musician. Unfortunately, you were born tone-deaf, and couldn't play an instrument to save your life. Unable to accept this reality, you followed a rumor leading you to meet with a hooded figure near a crossroads at midnight. The stranger took your instrument, tuned it, and played the most beautiful song you have ever heard. After it was returned, you obtained mastery over the instrument, and knew how to play it flawlessly. Even though your dream of becoming a talented musician was achieved, when you spot the cloaked stranger silently watching your concerts, you sometimes ask yourself if you made the wrong decision.",
  Folk_Hero:
    "Abducted: You were a commoner from an isolated village that rarely came in contact with the rest of civilization, except to buy and sell goods. One evening, while you were out on your porch, a bright light came from out of the sky and stole you away. While the details of your trip remain fuzzy, when you returned to your village, you had spontaneously learned how to channel arcane power you previously never had, among other things. Your new powers earned you the adoration and fear of the other common folk. Where your powers came from, or why you got them, remains a mystery to you.",
  Guild_Artisan:
    "Mad Artist: You were a skilled artisan in a guild of those with a similar craft. One night, you were approached by a powerful entity in your dreams who showed you the blueprints to a magnum opus, and commissioned you to create it. Creating such a piece would be extremely time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive, however the entity has promised you great rewards in exchange for constructing it.",
  Hermit:
    "Witch: You held ambitions of becoming a talented practitioner of forbidden magics. The practice of such witchcraft is taboo, and you would face certain execution if you were discovered. Secretly, you met with a few other like-minded individuals with similar dreams as you and formed a coven to summon a powerful outsider to make a pact with. After a long period of isolation in the wilderness, the coven discovered a forgotten ritual to conjure the name of an otherworldly being that would grant you all magical talents in exchange for servitude. The coven gladly accepted.",
  Noble:
    "New World Order: You are a member of an influential noble family that rose significantly in power almost overnight, upsetting the balance of powers in the political world. Unbeknownst to the public, your family has made deals with an extraplaner benefactor to mutually increase the influence of both parties involved. This is a very tightly held family secret, and if the scandal were to get out it would ruin the family name and likely result in open revolt.",
  Outlander:
    "Stranded: You were a hunter or traveler who, due to freak weather, faulty mapping, or arcane interference, found themselves hopelessly lost and on the verge of death. In your time of desperation, you called out to any divine being who might listen and begged them to save you. Your patron saw this opportunity and answered, forcing you to agree to every one of their terms in exchange for food and a way out. After surviving the ordeal, you begin to wonder if it was your patron who caused you to be lost in the first place...",
  Sage: "Occultist: You are an academic of the magical arts, and have spent years studying the history of spellcraft and the arcane. While researching planar magic, you stumbled upon, or sought out, an ancient book to commune with a mighty being from another plane of existence. After coming in contact with the book, the being was summoned and you found yourself either forced to accept its offer or allured by the promise of forgotten knowledge and arcana.",
  Sailor:
    "Cursed Treasure: There are rumors amongst sailors of cursed treasure stored inside damned grottos, and that any sailor who takes the treasure for themselves is doomed to serve a trickster god for the rest of their days. To you and your crewmembers, folklore became reality when you were mislead into forming a pact with an extraplaner patron after finding a mysterious stranded sailor who claimed to know the location of a lost pirate treasure. The ship soon became marooned in search of the treasure, and the stranded sailor revealed their true identity and forced the crew to make a pact with them in order to fix their ship and return home.",
  Soldier:
    "Besieged: You were a soldier in an army that was in charge of defending a castle or fortress that was surrounded by an enemy force. With supplies growing thin and the only choices appearing to be surrender or starvation, you made a pact with a mysterious stranger who offered to turn the tide of battle with arcane magic. You were granted the magical talents necessary to break the siege and route the enemy force. You tried to keep the pact secret from your comrades, but you were discovered and were forced to leave the army.",
  Urchin:
    "Orphic Orphanage: With no family to watch over you when you were young, you were sent to an orphanage after being discovered living on the streets. The kindly old woman who ran the orphanage was known to the children to be a different person behind closed doors; she taught the children the importance of planar summoning and occult rituals. You learned to invoke the name of a planar outsider, whom you made a magical pact with. Your relationship with your patron is like that of a parent and their children. You always felt comfort when you spoke with your patron, because you knew you were its child, and it would always love and protect you.",

  Charlatan:
    "Beguiler: You have used Enchantment magic to manipulate your way into high society, posing under a false identity such as a distant member of a noble family or a wealthy merchant with important ties. Regardless of the nature of your false identity, you get stolen respect and privilege from those who were unwise enough to trust you.",
  Criminal:
    "Left-Hand Path: Magic is an extremely dangerous tool that can be accessed by anyone with enough intelligence and patience, so it's no surprise that some governments would want to criminalize certain areas of study. You are a practitioner of these forbidden magics, such as necromancy, alchemical narcotics, or fiend conjuration. You studied your magic underground, away from the watchful eyes of the law, with the guidance of a secretive mentor.",

  Guild_Artisan:

  Hermit:
    "Recluse: Magic is something that takes a long time to master; many aspiring Wizards spend much of that time alone, hunched over spellbooks lit only by the light of a candle. You retreated to a solitary location to study magic, such as an abandoned library, quiet forest, or mountaintop retreat. You may have entered seclusion with a more talented mentor, who taught you the fundamentals of wizardry.",
