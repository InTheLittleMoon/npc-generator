# 🧙‍♂️ npc-generator

A lightweight NPC generator for Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. This tool creates random non-player characters, each with optional equipment, a background, and a name — or generates everything fully at random if no input is given.

- 🎭 Generates random NPCs with:
  - Auto-generated fantasy names (if none is entered)
  - One of several standard D&D character backgrounds
  - Optional basic equipment (some NPCs come prepared, some don’t)
- 🎰 Full RNG mode for completely randomized characters
